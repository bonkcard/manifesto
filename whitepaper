1. Abstract
BONKCard is a crypto-native debit card platform purpose-built for the $BONK ecosystem. It allows users to spend their $BONK tokens anywhere debit cards are accepted worldwide, creating seamless utility while embedding a sustainable deflationary model into its operations. BONKCard allocates 50% of its revenue toward open-market buybacks and permanent burns of $BONK, directly aligning platform growth with token scarcity.

With a transparent, on-chain burn mechanism, ultra-low fees, and decentralized design, BONKCard delivers an integrated economic engine that supports $BONK adoption while respecting the principles of user sovereignty, privacy, and scalability.

2. Introduction
$BONK is a widely held, highly liquid digital asset on the Solana blockchain with a vibrant community and growing integration footprint. BONKCard is designed to elevate $BONK’s role in decentralized finance by bridging it with real-world purchasing power — without intermediaries, high costs, or custodial risk.

The BONKCard platform combines non-custodial architecture, automatic on-chain tokenomics, and low-fee financial infrastructure into one seamless experience. Users can deposit $BONK, receive a debit card, and spend it globally — while every transaction contributes to a deflationary feedback loop benefiting all holders.

3. Platform Overview
BONKCard offers:

5. Tokenomics Integration
BONKCard embeds deflation directly into its operational model. Every time the platform generates revenue, the $BONK token becomes scarcer.

Buyback & Burn Process
Trigger: Buybacks are executed weekly using 50% of net platform revenue.

Mechanism: Revenue is used to acquire $BONK from open markets, increasing demand.

Burn: Acquired tokens are sent to an irrecoverable burn address, permanently reducing supply.

Transparency: Burns are verifiable via public blockchain explorers and BONKCard’s analytics dashboard.

Economic Function	Mechanism
Revenue Split	50% Buyback/Burn, 50% Operations
Frequency	Weekly (automated, on-chain)
Burn Record	On-chain, updated in real time
Buyback Source	Real platform revenue only

6. Fee Structure
BONKCard’s economic model is lean by design, ensuring broad accessibility and long-term competitiveness.

Fee Type	BONKCard Rate	Industry Standard
Card Issuance (One-Time)	$1 USD (in $BONK)	$5–$10
Transaction Fee	0.5%	1–2%
Monthly Account Fee	$0	$5–$20
Foreign Exchange Fee	0.5%	2–3%
Replacement Card Fee	At cost (minimal)	$10+
KYC Requirement	None	Mandatory

These competitive advantages ensure BONKCard is both economically sustainable and widely accessible.

7. Revenue Model
BONKCard generates revenue through:

Interchange Fees: Standard merchant network fees from each transaction.

Foreign Exchange Spread: Minimal markup on international usage.

Card Issuance Fees: Collected in $BONK at a fixed $1 equivalent.

Premium Services (Future): Optional, non-intrusive upgrades.

This revenue feeds directly into the platform’s buyback and burn operations, creating a self-reinforcing flywheel for $BONK value.
